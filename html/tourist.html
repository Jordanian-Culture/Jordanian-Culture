          <p id="font">
            Jordan is a major tourist destination in the Middle East, boasting unique natural wonders, untouched desert
            landscapes and impressive archaeological sites. For example, if you visit Jordan, you can enjoy the beauty
            of
            Petra. It's also called the Rose City. Petra’s geological and elaborate rock-cut architecture has made this
            site
            a national symbol of the country and an obvious contender to Wonders of the World lists. The city is today
            Jordan’s leading tourist attraction.
            Its major tourist attractions include visiting historical sites, like the worldwide famous Petra (UNESCO
            World
            Heritage Site since 1985, and one of New Seven Wonders of the World), the Jordan River, Mount Nebo, Madaba,
            numerous medieval mosques and churches, and unspoiled natural locations (as Wadi Rum and Jordan's northern
            mountainous region in general), as well as observing cultural and religious sites and traditions.

          <h2>Petra</h2>
          <p class="animation">The ancient city of Petra is one of Jordan’s national treasures and by far its best known
            tourist attraction.
            Petra is the legacy of the Nabataeans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more than
            2,000 years ago. Admired then for its refined culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams
            and
            water channels, Petra is a UNESCO World Heritages Site and one of the new Seven Wonders of the World.
            Inhabited by the Nabateans, Edomites and Romans, Petra brought together the knowledge and skill of these
            civilizations to create this world wonder. Caravans laden with incense, silks, spices and other exotic goods
            would rest at Petra.</p>

          <h4>Wadi-Rum</h4>
          <p class="animation">“The Valley of the Moon”, depicted as Mars in several Hollywood feature films Wadi Rum is
            an Arabian
            fairy-tale
            waiting to be discovered. Home to nomadic Bedouin tribes, Wadi Rum is a a quiet getaway of stars, sand, and
            sun;
            a perfect complement from Amman’s epicenter. Once inhabited by the Nabataeans of prehistoric times, Wadi Rum
            allows you to get lost in large landscapes and horizon lines. The calmness of the desert is sure calm your
            spirit and de-clutter your thoughts. Wadi Rum is waiting for you.</p>

          <h4>Dead Sea</h4>
          <p class="animation">
            A spectacular natural wonder the Dead Sea is perfect for religious tourism and fun in the sun with the
            family. With its mix of beach living and religious history you can soak up the sun while Biblical scholars
            can get their daily dose of religious history. The leading attraction at the Dead Sea is the warm, soothing,
            super salty water itself – some ten times saltier than sea water, and rich in chloride salts of magnesium,
            sodium, potassium, bromine and several others. The unusually warm, incredibly buoyant and mineral-rich
            waters have attracted visitors since ancient times, including King Herod the Great and the beautiful
            Egyptian Queen, Cleopatra. </p>

          <h4>
            Roman Amphitheater of Amman</h4>
          <p class="animation">

            The Roman Amphitheater of Amman is one of the biggest tourist attractions of Jordan, and also one of the
            most impressive. It was built in the II century b. C. but the past of time is almost imperceptible, the
            building is very preserved. The Amphitheater has room for 6,000 people, and from the top of the building the
            views are amazing. It’s such an amazing building that it has been used as scenario for various movies and
            advertisements. If you visit Amman, this is a place you have to go without a doubt. </p>

          <h4> Amman Citadel</h4>
          <p class="animation">

            The Amman citadel is one of the spots on the Jordanian capital with the best panoramic views of the city.
            From this corner you can see the hills that have embraced this city. Another one of the beauties you can
            see, are the mosques and one of the most incredible moments is when you hear the prayer of the Muslims. Like
            in most lookouts, the prettiest moments to admire the landscape are in the morning, at dawn, or when the
            night arrives.

            The citadel is also known for sheltering many archeological artifacts from the Roman Ages. These are in a
            little museum that is easy to tour, and visits are organized in many languages.
